== About
GRACE was founded in the fall of 2015 to foster networking and support between the graduate women of ECE and CS. The biweekly lunches provide a supportive environment for mentoring and support between graduate students.

Anyone is welcome to join us, particularly women who are graduate students in ECE & CS. 

== Contact
You can contact the organizers here: grace-request {at} lists {dot} johnshopkins {dot} edu \n
Please contact this address if you would like to join the mailing list.

== Resources
We have a [resources.html Resource Page] with some resources and information for people looking for additional communites, or looking to learn more. \n
This is not an endorsement of any organization or idea, but rather a starting place for learning more and continuing the conversation.
